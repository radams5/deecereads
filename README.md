This app was my first ever project as a student at DevMountain.  The goal was to create a full stack app using the various libraries we had been taught and to include new technologies as well.

DeeceReads is meant to be similiar to goodreads.com.  I wanted an app that would let you build a library, and wish list so that you could remember all the books that you've read and be able to recommend them to friends when talking about the usual "Read any good books lately?"
